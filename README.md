# What's inside the box?
The goal of this year's challenge it inspire a target audience of middle school kids to want to learn to code. Specifically, you will use a well known public API to which you have access (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc) to create a project that illustrates to the user how to use an API: the idea being to show the kids how open systems can lead to the creation of a new system and/or reimagining of the use case for the original system. 

The criteria for judgement are 

* Effective engagement with the target audience
* Creative solution to the problem
* Elegant technical implementation
* Number of API endpoints leveraged
